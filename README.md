# Housing-Prices
Implement Regression Models for Modeling Housing Data

Objective: Given housing data of 80 features and 1600 samples, the objective was to build a regression model to accurately predict the prices of new housing data. Accuracy was tested by trying to minimize the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE).

Implementation: This project utilized the whole data science process, from data cleaning to model building. My implementations included PCA, Gaussian Mixture Model clustering, XG_Boost, Random Forest, and Ridge/Lasso Regression.

Results: The best model I achieved was through stacking XG_Boost, Gradient Boosting, and Ridge Regression. This model's RMSLE was approximately .128, placing me in the top 33% of Kaggle Submissions.
